I created this calculator as a learning experience and implemented features that I thought would be fun/challenging.

## Technique

The solution is written in a JavaFX FXML project.
Calculation is done by using the Shunting-yard algorithm.

## Functions

- Log window with previous equations
- Dynamically updates current solution of equation in display
- Views current equation in smaller display
